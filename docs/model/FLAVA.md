**Summary:** Flava is a multimodal transformer model designed to handle both vision and language tasks, as well as their combination. It is trained on large-scale image, text, and image-text data, enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks including image classification, text classification, image-text retrieval, and multimodal reasoning. Flava features separate unimodal encoders for images and text, as well as a multimodal encoder for joint understanding, allowing flexible and effective learning across modalities. The model demonstrates strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and generalization ability.
